    <div> </div> can be thought of as a container for other elements. Elements are displayed on the browser based on the order they
    are written in the HTML file. Using the div element as a container for several elements, we can treat each div section as a single element, thus
    allowing us to position the entire group as one. Multiple layers of div can also be used as you will see in the other landing pages in this root folder.-->

    <!--The following div has a class attribute called "left-panel". Think of it as a way to identify different divs
        but there is another attribute called 'id' which is similar but provides more unique functionalities compared to 'class'
        More importantly, 'class' allows us to target specific div elements with CSS. -->

             AMBIGUITY: I tested just having 'name' or 'value' defined and it seems that the two has to
             be defined the same way together for the logic in the app.py to work. Needs more looking into.-->
